<p>I would say that I'm genuine in all things I do. I look out for people even if I don't know them that well. I see the best in almost everyone I meet - if they're rude or mean I just assume that it's because of events that have happened in their lives and not simply because some people are just mean to be mean. I love animals. I could never move away (even though I really want to) because my family means the world to me. I love to laugh and be silly but also know when to be serious. I tend to think I am always right. I take on way too many responsibilites even if it stresses me out because I can't say no for fear of letting someone down. I would rather stress myself out than say no to someone and have them feel stressed. I cannot wait to have a family of my own someday but fear that day is very far into my future. My biggest fear in life is never experiencing true love.</p>
